Changed Administration page to have nice linked images instead of boring buttons.

Have not been keeping this file updated!


20130522  v1.1.1 All maps changed to default to Open Street maps. Front page image for road project changed.

20130522  Make sure development server is not running when committing files! It will place a lock on those files, which will be committed along with the file!

20130522  Problem identified: A change in the development version of OpenLayers.js causes the editmap of olwidget to fail (add feature page).
The workaround is to go back to stable release. This fixes editmap, but google-sattelite now has nagging popup at each mouse-click! No work-around for this - so fix must be considered temporary.
