Added "Preview not available" image in case no pdf-file thumbnail is found for
a report. Some minor changes to layout: positioning of the thumbnail in the report detail view, and highlight of rows in tables confined to class "entity-list" which is applied only to lists of reports, persons, features etc.

Created a management script to create thumbnails of the first page of the pdf files.
The script is run by invoking the command: python manage.py create_pub_thumbs.
Report detail template updated to show the thumbnail of the report title page.

Added two new features: 
1) Possibility to upload line features and polygon features through the feature xlsx file which previously only supported points. 
2) Possibility to upload multiple files and images to features.

20130522  v1.1.1 All maps changed to default to Open Street maps. Front page image for road project changed.

20130522  Make sure development server is not running when committing files! It will place a lock on those files, which will be committed along with the file!

20130522  Problem identified: A change in the development version of OpenLayers.js causes the editmap of olwidget to fail (add feature page).
The workaround is to go back to stable release. This fixes editmap, but google-sattelite now has nagging popup at each mouse-click! No work-around for this - so fix must be considered temporary.
